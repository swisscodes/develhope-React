Events 04

Modifiy the `ClickTracker` so that each button contains an image instead of a text. How does this affect the event handler?

Now the img element is shadowing the botton onClick now we cant click the 
button the click now goes to img 
maybe we need to give the onclick to the img
or disbale its pointer event
